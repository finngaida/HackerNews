# HackerNews
---------
Obviously there are several Hacker News iOS Apps on the AppStore, but none of them suits my needs perfectly, so I decided to start my own project.

## Features
- List current top links in a table
- Load preview images for every entry lazily
- Peek into articles and add to Reading List from there
- Awesome reload control

## ToDos
- Implement caching
- Have the reload actually work
- Improve design
